# Data Structures and Algorithms Library
A simple library of basic data structures and algorithms implemented in `C++`. The data structures are implemented as **template classes** so that they can be adapted to different data types. I also implemented methods for displaying binary trees in the command prompt (see details in the `.h` files).



## Environment

- Tested on **Visual Studio 2010**.
- Tested on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** with `g++ 7.4.0`.
